# Intro to Active Directory Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Active Directory (AD) is a software-based directory service developed by Microsoft. It serves as a centralized database for user, device, and network resource (e.g., files, printers, permissions) management. It provides administrators with an organized, low learning curve, and powerful mechanism for network authentication and authorization, security policy enforcement, and resource access control.

## 1. <a name="benefits">Benefits of Using Active Directory</a>

*There are diverse advantages of using Active Directory (AD):*

* **Centralized Network Management:** AD serves as an organized and centralized/unified mechanism for user, device, and network resource (e.g., files, printers, permissions) management, promoting a highly efficient and convenient-to-manage network.
* **High Security:** AD manages network resource access through hardened authentication and authorization mechanisms. Group Policy Objects (GPOs) provide a standard for applying security settings and password policies (e.g., complexity, history) to a network as a whole.
* **Easy Access and Collaboration**: Since network resources and access to them are managed in a centralized and well-organized manner, they can be made reliably available to the proper users and groups (even when resources need to be shared and teams/groups need to collaborate).
* **Seamless Microsoft Integrations:** AD can be easily integrated with other Microsoft networking solutions (e.g., SharePoint, Exchange Server).
* **Impressive Scalability:** Even large enterprise network traffic can be handled by AD. Network objects can consistently apply their policies to high and low traffic scenarios. 
* **Single Sign-On (SSO) Mechanism:** Users can securely and conveniently access a variety of network resources with just one log-in.
* **High Availability:** The availability of directory services can be trusted, due to AD's support of redundancy/replication and failover. This provides even large enterprises with reason to trust AD for their business continuity needs (and as a solution for organizing and maintaining these needs, such as cold, warm, and hot sites).
